# Penn TotalRecall #
## An easy-to-use tool for quickly annotating audio files. ##

### Overview ###
TotalRecall is designed for precise scoring and timing of participant responses during verbal tasks, especially Free Recall.
However, it can be used for many kinds of audio annotation. TotalRecall displays an audio recording as a self-scrolling waveform that automatically keeps up with audio playback.

TotalRecall is used on a daily basis by many in the Computational Memory Lab. Support and maintenance will continue indefinitely with new features being added as needed.
